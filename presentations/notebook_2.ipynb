    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) may be thought of as a generalization of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) with $M$ salesmen instead of one. Specifically, we have depot with a certain amount of goods that need to be delivered to a number of clients located at different places. The depot has access to $M$ delivery vehicles to make these deliveries. Let $N$ be the number of clients. Consider a fully connected graph of $N + 1$ nodes with the depot being the node $0$ and the variouis clients being nodes $\\{1, 2, \\dots N\\}$. Every edge $(i, j)$ of this fully connected graph represents the cost of moving from node $i$ to node $j$. This cost could be the time taken, the distance covered or anything at all that needs to be minimized. In our case, we have chosen it to be distance. The objective is to simply find the optimal route through this graph, for each vehicle, so that all deliveries are made with minimum cost. We use the following notation for the rest of this document:\n",
    "\n",
    " - *$N$: number of clients, excluding the depot*\n",
    " - *$M$: number of vehicles*\n",
    " - *$C_{ij}$: cost of moving from node $i$ to node $j$*\n",
    " - *$x_{ij}, x_{ijk}$: binary decision variables*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Find the optimal route for all $M$ vehicles covering all $N$ routes so that the total cost of this route is minimized."
